Tailwind CLI setup for Classroom Team Game

Commands:
- npm install
- npm run build:css    # builds ./dist/styles.css from ./src/input.css
- npm run watch:css    # watch for changes and rebuild
- npm run dev          # watch css and serve the app at http://localhost:8080

The app now links to ./dist/styles.css instead of using the Tailwind CDN.
